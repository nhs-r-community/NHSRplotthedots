This package is built by the NHS-R community to provide tools for drawing statistical process control (SPC) charts. This package supports the NHSE/I programme ['Making Data Count'](https://www.england.nhs.uk/a-focus-on-staff-health-and-wellbeing/publications-and-resources/making-data-count/), and allows users to draw XmR charts, use change points, and apply rules with summary indicators for when rules are breached.

This package is in the very early stages of development and is not stable for use at this point.

## Installation

As the package develops there will be a full release onto the main branch but until that time you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRplotthedots@development")
```

# Contribution

This is an NHS-R Community project that is open for anyone to contribute to in any way that they are able. If you want to learn more about this please join the discussion at [the NHS-R Community Slack group](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/) and the specific channel # proj-shiny-spc.
