This package is built by the NHS-R community to provide tools for drawing statistical process control (SPC) charts. This package supports the NHSE/I programme ['Making Data Count'](https://www.england.nhs.uk/a-focus-on-staff-health-and-wellbeing/publications-and-resources/making-data-count/), and allows users to draw XmR charts, use change points, and apply rules with summary indicators for when rules are breached.

Please be aware that this package is in the early stages of development, and features may change.

## Installation

As the package develops there will be a full release to CRAN if possible, but until that time you can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the `remotes` package  with:

```{r. eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRplotthedots")
```

# Overview


Welcome to the NHS-R community's collaborative package for building a specific type of statistical process control (SPC) chart, the XmR chart.  We are aiming to support the NHS England and NHS Improvement's 'Making Data Count' programme, please see <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/a-focus-on-staff-health-and-wellbeing/publications-and-resources/making-data-count/"> here </a> for more details.  The programme encourages boards, managers, and analyst teams to present data in ways that show change over time, and drive better understanding of indicators than 'RAG' (red, amber, green) rated board reports often present.

The help-files, and vignette within this package tell you more about the possible options for controlling the charts, but below is a simple example of the type of chart the package produces.  We will use the `ae_attendances` dataset from the `NHSRdatasets` package and a bit of `tidyverse` `dplyr` code to select some organisations.

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(NHSRplotthedots)
library(NHSRdatasets)
library(tidyverse)

sub_set <- 
  ae_attendances %>% 
  filter(org_code == 'RQM' & type ==1 & period < as.Date('2018-04-01'))

spc(sub_set, valueField = "breaches", dateField = "period"
    , options = spcOptions(improvementDirection = "decrease"
                           , yAxisLabel = "4-hour wait breaches"
                           , mainTitle = "SPC of A&E waiting time breaches for RQM"))

```


To view the vignette, use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
vignette("intro",package =  "NHSRplotthedots")

vignette(package =  "NHSRplotthedots")

```
