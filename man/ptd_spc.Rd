\usage{
ptd_spc(
  .data,
  value_field,
  date_field,
  facet_field = NULL,
  rebase = NULL,
  fix_after_n_points = NULL,
  improvement_direction = "increase",
  target = NULL,
  trajectory = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing a value field, a date field,
and a category field (if for faceting). There should be no gaps in the time series
for each category.}

\item{value_field}{Specify the field name which contains the value data, to be plotted on y axis.
Field name can be specified using non-standard evaluation (i.e. no quotation marks).}

\item{date_field}{Specify the field name which contains the date data, to be plotted on x axis.
Field name can be specified using non-standard evaluation (i.e. no quotation marks).}

\item{facet_field}{Optional: Specify field name which contains a grouping/faceting variable. SPC logic will be
applied to each group separately, with outputs combined. Currently accepts 1 variable only.
Field name can be specified using non-standard evaluation (i.e. no quotation marks).}

\item{rebase}{Specify a field name which contains a control limit rebasing flag.
This field should contain integer values 0 and 1, and any date value where the rebase field is 1 will
trigger a recalculation of the control limits.
Field name can be specified using non-standard evaluation (i.e. no quotation marks).}

\item{fix_after_n_points}{Specify a number points after which to fix SPC calculations.}

\item{improvement_direction}{Specify whether an increase or decrease in measured variable signifies
process improvement. Accepted values are 'increase' for increase as improvement or 'decrease' for
decrease as improvement. Defaults to 'increase'.}

\item{target}{Specify a field name which contains a target value.
Field name can be specified using non-standard evaluation (i.e. no quotation marks).}

\item{trajectory}{Specify a field name which contains a trajectory value.
Field name can be specified using non-standard evaluation (i.e. no quotation marks).}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object of the spc charts.  This will automatically print the plot, but can also be saved as an
object if you want to manipulate it further.
}
\description{
\code{ptd_spc} returns a plot object or data table with SPC values using NHSI 'plot the dots' logic.
}
\details{
This function is designed to produce consistent SPC charts
across Information Department reporting, according to the 'plot the dots'
logic produced by NHSI. The function can return either a plot or data frame.

\examples{
library(NHSRdatasets)
data("ae_attendances")

# Pick a trust at random to look at their data for two years
trust1 <- subset(ae_attendances, org_code == "RJZ" & type == 1)

# Basic chart with improvement direction decreasing
ptd_spc(trust1,
  value_field = "breaches", date_field = "period",
  improvement_direction = "decrease"
)

# Pick a few trust, and plot individually using facet
# Also set the x-axis scale to vary for each and date groups to 3 months
orgs <- ae_attendances$org_code \%in\% c("RAS", "RJZ", "RR1", "RJC", "RQ1")
trusts4 <- subset(ae_attendances, orgs & type == 1)

s <- ptd_spc(trusts4,
  value_field = "breaches", date_field = "period", facet_field = "org_code",
  improvement_direction = "decrease"
)
plot(s, fixed_y_axis_multiple = FALSE, x_axis_breaks = "3 months")

# Save the first chart as an object this time then alter the ggplot theme
my_spc <- ptd_spc(trust1,
  value_field = "breaches", date_field = "period",
  improvement_direction = "decrease"
)

plot(my_spc) + ggplot2::theme_classic()
}
